    title: Profile
    content: |
      I make web applications that power business.
      My experience covers the 'full stack' of web applications: from the initial idea through to design, development and finally deployment and maintenance.
      I have over 12 years of industry experience, including: corporate and enterprise, various sizes/stages of start-ups, creative agencies, freelance and contract work.
      For the last 5 years I have specialised in Ruby development as well as picking up later technology (Node + Go) for use where appropriate.
      Many latest projects also include at least some degree of remote work, giving me organisational skills and experience of working off-site
      as well as on-site, mentoring / knowledge sharing with remote teams and the the infrastructure to enable this.
      My aim is always to create a technically, aesthetically and functionally pleasing product which is why I take great pride in my work.

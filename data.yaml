    content: |
      In my 22-year career working in startups, SMEs and public sector projects, I have developed the skills and reputation for delivering elegant technical solutions to diverse business problems.
      With the breadth of experience, resilience and adaptability to challenges, I have often led greenfield and ambitious moonshot projects for clients and within companies.
      My strength is the combination of technical and business understandings, with the people skills to build relationships, a sense of community and enthusiasm around our work - effectively bridging the gaps, amplifying people's strengths and delivering the vision.

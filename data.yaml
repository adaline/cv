    content: |
      I make web applications that power business.
      My experience covers the 'full stack' of web applications: from the initial idea through to design, development and finally deployment and maintenance.
      I have over 12 years of industry experience with all manner of clients and projects and my aim is always to create a technically, aesthetically and functionally pleasing product which is why I take great pride in my work.
